                                <p>The ongoing debate about the legality and rules of gambling continues; it’s a known fact that people love to gamble. The Indian government’s outlook towards gambling and betting is considered a grey area. A few sports have approval from the authorities while others are illegal.
<br>
Currently, online poker, online rummy, lottery, sports betting and a few casinos are legal in India. To understand the gambling rules and regulations, Fun88 India has addressed the rules of gambling as below:</p>
								<h3 class="title">Sports Betting Rules
</h3>
                                <p>Some Events and Markets have different bet rules and these are listed below in the Specific Event/Market Betting Rules for each specific Event or Market/bet type on the Fun88 website. The following are the general rules of sports betting applicable to all Events and Markets/bet types, full compliance is mandatory. Where applicable, provisions and definitions set out in the Terms and Conditions published on the Company’s website shall apply to these online Gambling & Betting Rules and Regulations.</p>
								<h3 class="title">1. General Gambling Rules</h3>
                                <p>All Betting Information supplied by the Company is done so in good faith. However, the Company cannot accept liability for any errors or omissions with respect to dates, times, venues, competitors, odds, results, statistics, jerseys (displayed at Live Streaming) or other Betting Information. The Company reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that Markets, which are defined as different Bet Types offered on a certain sporting event, are administered with integrity and transparency. The company reserves the right to make the final decision.

If an Event, which is defined as an organized sports match or event between two teams or between individuals, begins before the scheduled time then only bets placed before the start of the Event (excluding specified live betting) will be considered valid. If a Market is not closed or suspended at the correct time then the Company reserves the right to void all bets placed after the actual start time (excluding specified live betting).

In the event of any inconsistency between the English and the Non-English names used for the events or teams on the Website, it is the English version that shall prevail. At all times, it is the customer’s responsibility to be aware of the match score and all relevant match information and it is advised that the customer verify the match status before placing a bet.

The Company reserves the right to amend these Rules at any time for any reason(s). Any such revision will be binding and effective immediately upon posting on the Website.

The customer acknowledges that the current score, the time elapsed and other data provided on the site, while coming from a “live” feed provided by a third party is subject to a time delay and/or may be inaccurate and that any bet placed based on this data is entirely at the customer’s own risk. The Company provides this data as-is with no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of such data and accepts no responsibility for any loss (direct or indirect) suffered by the customer as a result of his reliance on it.

The Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to cancel or declare a bet void or suspend a customer without prior notification, under any of the following circumstances:

• The bet details are incomplete or erroneous;

• The bet placed is more than the limits allowed by the rules;

• The bet has been placed in contravention of the rules;

• Human errors in typing or transmission resulting in the use of incorrect gaming data or odds;

• If and when there appears to be an abnormal or irregular use of the gaming platform or there appears to have an excessively high number of losses or winnings.

READ! Rules on Responsible Gaming

The Company reserves the right to suspend a game or specific product to correct any obvious errors, and maintain the integrity and fairness of the said game.

Once a bet is confirmed by the Company, the bet can no longer be amended or cancelled by the customer.

If a customer has any doubt or suspects that something is wrong in the system, the customer is advised to stop playing and coordinate with the Company’s customer support department. If the customer continues to play, he accepts responsibility for the outcome of his bets and the Company has the sole discretion whether or not to address the issue.

Where a live match or game begins and bets were made while the event is in running and if for any reason the stream is disconnected, regardless of the cause of such disconnection, or the stream freezes or crashes, any bets taken will still stand and be settled when the event has been completed and when the result is known. This general bet rule shall not apply in cases where a game or a product has a specific rule on disconnection in which case, the specific rule shall apply and the result based on the specific rule shall be binding upon the customer.

The Company reserves the right to suspend and/or close a customer's account at any time if it is believed that the customer violated any of the applicable rules and regulations or cheated, hacked, attacked, manipulated or damaged the normal betting procedure or if the customer is engaged in money laundering or other illegal activities or is below the legal age required to engage in gambling in his jurisdiction or actual location. Once the account of the customer is closed for the said reason, all winnings and/or payout including the balance in the customer’s account shall be forfeited.

The Company reserves the right to set the maximum amount of pay-outs for its existing products and products to be offered.

The Company reserves the right to withhold payment if it has evidence that the prices or the pool have been manipulated or where a race, event or match has been rigged. Evidence of the above may be based on the size, volume or pattern of bets placed across any or all of our betting channels. If there is any dispute over the interpretation of these rules, the Company's interpretation shall prevail.

The Company reserves the right to void and cancel all bets that are involved with illegal betting activities.

The Company reserves the right to refuse customers to enter the games or kick customers from the games.

								<h3 class="title">2. Abandonments and Postponements- Void in Betting</h3>
                                <p>If an Event does not begin on the scheduled start date and is not completed within the originally scheduled completion date prescribed in the specific sports rules, then all bets will be void, except for those on Markets that have been unconditionally determined.

If an Event starts but is later abandoned, and is not completed within the originally scheduled completion date prescribed in the specific sports rules, then all bets will be void, except for those on Markets that have been unconditionally determined.

If an Event is not completed within the originally scheduled completion time prescribed in the specific sports rules thus an official result is declared or a result is declared by the particular Event’s relevant governing body, the Company reserves the right to consider the match officially valid. The Company’s decision is final and binding in this regard.</p>
								<h3 class="title">3. Change of Venue</h3>
                                <p>Unless otherwise stated, If a match is scheduled to be played on neutral ground but is played on non-neutral ground or vice versa, all bets will still be considered valid. In the event of a change of venue where the home team plays away or vice versa, all bets on the match will be considered void. Bets will also be considered void if the home and away team names are wrongly stated in reverse.

For all non-team Events, if the scheduled venue is changed after the Market has been opened, then all bets will still be considered valid.</p>
								<h3 class="title">4. Time Duration</h3>
                                <p>The posted duration of an Event is for reference purposes only. Bets will be valid despite the change in scheduled duration.

Any incident during injury or stoppage time that is played is deemed to have occurred at the end of regular time, e.g. a goal scored in the first-half injury time of a soccer match is deemed to have been scored on 45 minutes.</p>
								<h3 class="title">5. Betting Results</h3>
                                <p>Where relevant, podium positions will count as the official result, regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the results. If there is no podium ceremony, results will be determined following the official result of the relevant governing body at the time of the Market settlement, regardless of any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the results. If no official result is available then the result will be determined concerning the available evidence known at the time of Market settlement.

Markets are generally settled shortly after the conclusion of an Event. Purely as customer service, some Markets may be settled before the official result is declared. The Company reserves the right to reverse settlement in the Event of a Market being settled in error.

In the Event of uncertainty over any result then the Company reserves the right to suspend settlement of any Market.

Except for non-existent matches, the Company will not void or refund settled bets due to any amendments or changes to the results, team names, or any other match details made 72 hours after the Event start time or for bets that have already been settled.

Where there is a conflict between the official results and the results posted on the results section of the Company's Website, the conflict shall be resolved by reference to the Company's video recording of the particular Event to determine the correct result. However, if no such video recording is available, then the correct result shall be determined following the result of the particular Event's relevant governing body as published on its official website. If the official website is unable to provide the result or the official website's posted result is manifestly wrong, then the Company reserves the right to make decisions/ amendments to determine the final result. The Company's decision is final and binding in this regard.

The winner of an Event is determined after the Event for purposes of determining the winning bets regardless of the subsequent reversal of decisions or the result of any protest or appeal.</p>
								<h3 class="title">6. Auto Timer Acceptance</h3>
                                <p>For certain events as may be determined by the Company, a customer may place a bet using the Timer Acceptance feature by selecting the "Timer Accept" button on the menu. Each bet placed using timer acceptance will have its countdown timer, the duration of which will be at the sole and exclusive determination of the Company. At the end of the timer, without any of the disruptions mentioned in Section 1.6.2, the bet will be accepted.

If any of the disruptions mentioned in this Section happen before the countdown timer ends, all bets placed using Timer Acceptance are immediately void;

If there appears to be a possible red card or a red card is given;

If there is a possible penalty or a penalty is given;

If there appears to be a possible goal or a goal is scored by any team;

Fortuitous events include but are not limited to, failure in any equipment or telecommunication that prevents the correct placing, accepting, recording or notification of bets, delays or interruptions in operation or transmission, and communication lines failure.

In using the Timer Acceptance feature, the customer acknowledges that the current score, the time elapsed and other data provided on this site, while coming from a "live" feed provided by a third party is subject to a time delay and/or may be inaccurate and that any bet placed based on this data is entirely at the customer's own risk. The Company provides this data and accepts no responsibility for any loss ( direct or indirect) suffered by the customer as a result of his reliance on it.</p>
								<h3 class="title">7. Cash Out a Bet Rule</h3>
                                <p>Cash Out gives the customers the option to sell the whole or portion of their bet tickets before the results of selected events or fixtures are determined.

Cash Out is available only for In-Running (“Live”) Betting events, fixtures or markets having a Cash Out icon.

Cash Out is not available in Parlays, other multiple betting options and bets using free bets.

A portion of the bet ticket can be sold as long as the remaining balance of the bet ticket will not be equal to or less than 20% of the original stake. The minimum partial Cash Out amount is at least 20% of the original stake of the bet ticket. Real-time Live Market prices determine the Cash Out value. Customers may not use the Cash Out option if the Cash Out value changes or if the market is suspended. Customers can retry until the sale of the bet ticket in Cash Out is successfully accepted by the system.

Once the sale of the bet ticket is successfully accepted by the system, the customer is no longer allowed to cancel the sale. The Cash-Out value of fully sold bet tickets will be credited back to the customer’s balance and the Cash Out value will not be affected by the official result of the event, fixture or market where the bets were placed.

The Company reserves the right to reverse the settlement of the bet ticket sold using the Cash Out option if there was an error in the settlement or in cases where the Company deems it reasonably necessary to reverse the settlement.

In case of reversal of settlement, the Cash Out value of the bet ticket received by the customer will be deducted from his account balance and the bet ticket will retain its original stake or its remaining value at the time it was sold in the case where partial Cash Out was previously made. In case of cancellation of the selected event or fixture wherein a bet, ticket is sold, the sale of the bet ticket will be reversed unless the bet has been determined.

The Cash-Out value of the bet ticket will be deducted from the customer’s account and the original stake will be credited back to the customer. The Cash Out value of the bet ticket will be credited to the customer’s account within a reasonable period of time.

The Company reserves the right and has the sole and absolute discretion to accept or decline the use of Cash Out, to make the Cash Out option available in certain events, fixtures or markets and to amend, suspend or remove the Cash Out option as it deems necessary.

The customer understands that the Company is not responsible for the unavailability of the Cash Out option due to technical errors.

The customer understands that Cash Out is a product provided by a third party. The third party shall be ultimately responsible for the settlement of bet tickets sold through Cash Out and any other claims made by the customer arising out of the use of Cash Out. The Company accepts no responsibility for any loss (direct or indirect) suffered by the customer in using Cash Out.

The Cash Out feature shall not be available to Customers who have availed of or used a Bonus offered by the Company until the Customer has qualified and met the Terms and Conditions for the said Bonus. Customers who will opt to avail of the Cash Out feature may request Customer Service to have the Bonus forfeited in order to avail of the Cash Out. The Company shall have the final decision on whether to allow the forfeiture of the Bonus and to grant access to the Cash Out.</p>
